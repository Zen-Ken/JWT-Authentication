# JWT-Session

A simple Express.js API demonstrating JWT authentication with access tokens and refresh tokens. Features user registration, login, token refresh, token introspection, and secure logout with refresh tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.

# Getting Started

# Purpose

This is a bare minimum secure implementation of stateless authentication using JWT. This repository is used to observe the JWT authentication flow. Can be forked to sandbox and demonstrate vulnerabilities that may appear in CTF.

# ToDo's

- [ ] Explore JWE (JSON Web Token Encrypted)
- [ ] Make an OAuth 2.0 with JWT Client Assertion (RFC 7523) example (aka. Service-to-Service)
